They have been eradicated from North Isabela, Baltra, Espa�ola, Plaza Sur, Santa Fe, Marchena, R�bida, Santiago, and Pinta.",,"This domesticated mammal is a ruminant herbivore, approximately one meter in height.  Goats generally have short, rough hair of variable color and pattern, large horns that are hollow and turned back, tufts of long hair hanging from the lower jaw, and a short tail. The female is smaller than the male and sometimes without horns. They have a scent gland near the feet and groin but lack interdigital and lacrimal glands. Gestation lasts approximately 150 days. These feral animals show marked sexual dimorphism in size, color, and horns characteristics. The goat is considered to be one of the hundred most harmful invasive species in the world."

Sexually dimorphic, males are generally larger than females, An adult male can measure from 0.9 to 2 m. length (without tail), and from 0.55 to 1.1 m tall at the shoulder. The average weight is 50 to 90 kg, although there are races that can reach 300 kg. Females can measure between 0.8 to 1.35 cm in length and an average weight of 45 kg. The tusks of adult males grow continuously, the upper tusks are bent upwards, are their lethal weapons for defense. The tusks of the females are short and do not protrude. Pigs have a jaw adapted to eat vegetables, but are usually omnivorous and their diet can include eggs and juvenile tortoises and turtles, endemic reptiles and seabirds. The sense of smell of pigs is highly developed, in Europe they are used to find truffles. The males are usually solitary, while the females with their young and sub-adults live in groups called sounders. Herds usually have around 20 animals, although there have been groups of up to 50. The herds include three breeding females, one of which is the dominant female. They are most active at night."

Nearly 800 breeds of dog are recognized. Like most mammalian predators, the dog has strong muscles and a well developed cardiovascular system that give them both endurance and speed. They have an highly developed senses of smell and hearingand teeth that are adapted to hold and tear prey. Size, body form, strength, endurance, and fur coat depend on breed. There is little sexual dimorphism, however, males tend to be larger and more muscular. This species has coexisted with humans about 14,000 years, as companions and service animals.  They have been trained for service (guide dogs), guarding, hunting, racing, and shepharding. Dogs are social animals with a well-established dominance hierarchy. Their average lifespan is 15 years."
Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Felis,catus,In,,,,True,True,,True,,,,True,True,,,,,,Cat,"Felino, Gato dom�stico",Gato dom�stico introducido,"Synonyms: Felis catus domestica, Erxleben 1777 and Felis sylvestris Schreber 1777. There is some confusion as to the correct species name. Schreber (1775) illustrated a plate as 'Felis Catus ferus', and in 1777 the text listed 'Felis (Catus) silvestris' and 'Felis Catus (domestica).' Opinion 465 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1957f) declared silvestris as the specific name for the European wild cat (with the understanding that F. catus and F. silvestris are usually considered conspecific). Wilson & Reeder (eds., 2005) note that some consider catus and sylvestris (and lybica/libyca) to be conspecific. If this view were followed, there would be a problem with the continued use of the name Felis sylvestri.","They are widely distributed in Floreana, Santa Cruz, Isabela and San Cristobal, where they are feral and as pets in populated areas. They were eradicated from Baltra Island in 2004.",,"The domestic cat is a carnivorous mammal in the Felidae family. They are predators by nature that often hunt at night and prey on numerous species of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. They have a soft, wooly fur with a shiny appearance that they maintain by frequent grooming. Their body is flexible, light, muscular and compact with around head and short ears. Their forelimbs usually have five digits and hind legs have four with naked digital pads that allow them to stalk prey quietly. Their claws are retractable, long, sharp, curvy and laterally compressed. The eye pupils contract vertically, they have a secondary eyelid or nictitating membrane to protect the eye. Their tongue is adapted to lacerate and detain food with the surface covered by curvy point papillae. Their teeth clearly reflect their predtor nature. They have a very good sight and hearing. They have glands in the head and tail which they use to mark their territory. Females possess four pairs of mammae.  Even when kept as pets, cats live in a semi-wild status (feral) and are among the IUCN 100 worst invasive species."
