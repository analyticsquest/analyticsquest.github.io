# Introduction to Python

This course will teach you how to use the computer programming language Python.

Many engineers, data scientist, and analyst use Python to explore, analyze, and present their data.

This course is designed to help you learn and understand a new language, as well as provide guidance on best practice for effective analytics.

Much like learning any new language, it will often be frustrating as you grapple with new words, meanings, and 
the nuts and bolts of specific grammar and syntax. However, the end result is beautiful. A whole new world will
be open before you, and you will be equiped with a powerful tool and principles to guide you through it.

The course assumes no prior knowledge of python, programming, or how we will interact with your computer via the command line interface.

By the end of the course you will be able to:

 - import and export data

 - produce publication-quality graphics and data visualization

 - analyze data and write up results correctly

 - be confident in continuing to learn python

 - articulate the principles of best practices in data management, data analysis, data visualization, workflow, and statistical approaches: And be useful with them!


Programming, writing code, command line interface, and collection, storage, analysis and display of data are all transferable skills that will be useful whatever software you end up using or work you end up doing.

Please note, this is _not_ a statistics course. Links to background material will be provided, but we will not attempt to teach you statistics.



## Deliberate Practice and Python Proficiency

The literature on learning suggests that three elements are helpful to learning a new skill quickly: repetition, assessment, and feedback.

Jupyter notebook is the perfect environment to learn the Python language for analytics. Enrolled students will engage in repeating tasks and new parts of the language every week. These commands are assessed immediately by Python when they are entered in the program, but Python does not in itself provide helpful assessment or feedback. We will submit jupyter notebooks to a class folder for assessment and feedback. 


## Learning Goals & Outcomes

Successful students will be able to:

1. **Foundational knowledge** (information and ideas)

 - Describe how Python differs from spreadsheets and point-and-click software,
 - Prepare data for use in Python,
 - Import and export various formats of data,
 - Describe the different types of objects and data,
 - Describe the use of functions and function arguments,
 - Identify what function to use for specific ideas, tests, or analysis,
 - Describe best practice in data management, analysis, and visualization.

 
2. **Application** (skills, thinking and project management)

 - Be confident managing, describing, analysing, and visualising data in Python,
 - Write your own functions,
 - Generate publication-quality data visualizations,
 - Run statistical tests and develop models to analyse data,
 - Produce results suitable for a publication.
 - Describe what someone else's Python code does.


3. **Integration** (connecting ideas)

 - Understand the different ways humans can interact with computers (CLI vs GUI),
 - Understand the pros and cons of open-source software,
 - Understand the pros and cons of reproducible research and analysis,
 - Correct and improve someone else's code.


4. **Human dimension** (learning about oneself and others)

 - Learn a new way of working with and looking at data,
 - Appreciate what learning a new complex skill feels like, and overcoming the frustration.


5. **Values** (developing new feelings, interests and values)

 - Critique published analyses and data visualization,
 - Support the community endeavour of science and open-source software.


6. **Learning how to learn** (becoming a better student and self-directed learner)

 - Work iteratively within Python to develop analyses, charts, and figures,
 - Use online and other resources to address specific problems,
 - Learn to discern good advice from bad.



## Course Outline

The course is modular and built around stand-alone units.

Each unit has: 

  - 4 or 5 Lessons, 

  - 3 labs, 

  - 1 recap, 

  - 1 best practice


### Lessons

Lessons are short (20--30 minute) scripts that run in the console or Jupyter notebook that each student works through independently.

These lessons will walk through Python commands, ideas, and challenge student to apply to solve problems faced in real world. 



### Labs

Each lesson will have an associated lab that reinforces the material and develops understanding and coding skills.


### Best Practice 

Each unit includes information on specific best practices.

These will include figure design, code syntax, data cleaning and management, presenting statistical test results.
